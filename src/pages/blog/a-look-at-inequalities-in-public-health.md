Health inequalities are a persistent issue in public health, creating systemic and avoidable disparities in health outcomes across different populations. These inequalities are rooted in the social, economic, and environmental factors popularly known as the social determinants of health (SDOH). They are visible in the quality and accessibility of care enjoyed by different population groups, and the health, well-being, and life expectancy of these individuals. Addressing health disparities through the SDOH lens is crucial in improving public health and achieving health equity because this approach highlights the sources of disparity, allowing public health experts and other stakeholders to devise proactive interventions.

SDOH are interrelated and encompass various individual and community factors, including economic stability, education, social and community life, and neighborhood. People’s income and employment status are central to health outcomes, since they determine a population’s ability to access nutritious food, safe housing, and primary care services. Low-income earners often experience chronic stress, limited access to primary care, and live in environments that expose them to health risks, including a polluted environment.

Access to quality education also affects health outcomes. Those with high levels of education can make informed health decisions and are often safe from common obstacles in service delivery, including language barriers and literacy issues. Moreover, access to education empowers individuals and communities to secure employment, contributing to economic stability. Marginalized and underserved communities, on the other hand, are susceptible to cycles of poverty that jeopardize access to quality and safe care.

Social relationships and community connections are significant health determiners. Strong social support networks are important in providing emotional and practical assistance, promoting mental and physical well-being. Civic engagement is also important, since it obligates the adoption of policies that advocate for access to safe and quality care by every population group. Conversely, social isolation, incarceration, and discrimination based on gender, race, and ethnicity negatively affect the health of some individuals and groups, resulting in unfavorable health outcomes.

Neighborhoods and built environments are another determiner of health. Easy access to safe housing, clean water, and healthy food significantly improves one’s chances of staying healthy. Violence, crime, and poor air quality can pose a risk to one’s mental and physical health, jeopardize the delivery of prompt healthcare services, and contribute to the prevalence of chronic illnesses, such as asthma and cardiovascular disease.

Reducing disparities in public health requires a multifaceted approach to tackle the SDOH and improve health equity. One such strategy is implementing policy and legislative changes. Governments should expand healthcare coverage, increase funding in education, and improve housing conditions to promote social justice and equal access to healthcare. Expanding Medicaid coverage, for instance, can encourage the uninsured and underinsured to access healthcare services since it cushions the expenses. Empowering education and providing easy access to this resource, especially for marginalized and underserved communities, can help in seeking prompt medical attention, reducing morbidity and mortality rates.

Expanding access to quality and safe care is another important approach to eliminating health disparities. This entails increasing the number of care providers, providing adequate care infrastructure, reducing waiting times, and ensuring care is affordable and culturally sensitive. Addressing implicit bias in service delivery can also optimize care quality and protect vulnerable communities from discrimination within facilities.

In addition, community-based interventions can address health inequities and promote communities’ health and well-being. Important stakeholders, including community leaders, religious leaders, and public health workers, can help bridge the gap between care providers and patients. These stakeholders can address myths and misconceptions against modern care, and encourage community members to take responsibility for their health by interacting and cooperating with care providers.

Finally, collaboration across various sectors is imperative in improving health equity. Public health professionals, policymakers, and educators should work together to devise dynamic solutions to health inequities. Government agencies should also foster partnerships with nonprofit organizations and the private sector to ensure effective resource allocation and the adoption of sustainable interventions.
